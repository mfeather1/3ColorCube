<br><br>
<p>A nice 4D Simulator which includes the Hypercube and much more is available 
at the 
<a target=_blank href=http://superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm>Magic Cube 4D</a>
web-site.
<br> <br>
An example facecolors file for a 4-Color Hypercube is
<a href=facecolors.txt>here</a>, put it in the same directory as the mc4d 
jar file as per the 
<a href=http://superliminal.com/cube/faq.html#Q16>faq</a>.
As can be seen on the image below the color is the same for each pair of
opposite cells.</p>

<br><br>
<p>To solve using this method, start mc4d with the 4-color facecolors.txt. 
Select puzzle Hypercube 3, do a full scramble and solve the corners
(using the 4-color macros).
Save a log file and then switch to eight colors by restarting mc4d without 
the facecolors.txt.
Open the log file and solve the corners again (using the 8-color macros).
Repeat the process for the edges.
<br><br>
The solve order is:<br>
4-color Corners<br>
8-color Corners<br>
4-color Edges<br>
8-color Edges
<br><br>
Solving the edges as 4-color slightly scrambles the corners but they remain
solvable with half-twists only.
<br><br>
Another way to solve is to use different shades of the same color for opposite
cell pairs as with this <a href=facecolors2.txt>facecolors.txt</a>.
This makes it easy to do the mental transition between 4-color and 8-color (no
switching with mc4d needed).
However, due to changes in shading as the hypercube rotates 
some of the colors are a bit hard to distinguish at certain angles.</p>
