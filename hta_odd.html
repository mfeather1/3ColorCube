<p>In this example the red-orange pair of faces have been completely solved
(as 3-color) and the corners have been solved on the remaining faces 
(as 3-color).
To solve the corners as 6-color the waterwheel sequence would be used (because
one and only one pair of faces can be solved with half-twists) but it is the
yellow-white pair of faces that are solvable with half-twists (and are already
solved) which means the cube needs to be turned so they are on the left and
right. After applying the waterwheel sequence one misplaced edge facelet (from
the red-orange pair) will need to be fixed. The table below the cube shows how
to proceed.</p>

</table>

<p>After move 10 the corners are solvable (as 6-color) with half-twists only
but there is no need to do so at this point.  After move 17 the cube is ready
to solve the remaining edges (as 3-color).
The corners will be solved as 6-color (with half-twists only) after the edges
are solved as 3-color.</p>
