<p>This demo shows how to solve the Starter Cube using the
<a href=starter.html>Starter Sequences</a>. 
The solution table shows the number of moves in each step and the sequences
used.
All of the starter sequences are shown below the cube.
Each M sequence makes the setup for an S sequence, S1 solves two misplaced
facelets and S2 solves four.
<br><br>
For the first step of solving the top face an optimal (fewest move) 
solution is shown, there is often more than one way to do it.
When solving manually you can solve the top face any way you like, it is very
easy.</p>
