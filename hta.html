<p>While the 3-color solving method shown on this web-site was developed
independently and is very different from HTA there are some obvious
similarities in that both start by solving as a 3-color cube and both finish
by reaching a configuration that can be solved with half-twists.
The 3-Color Cube method can be modified to work a bit more like HTA by doing the
following.
<br><br>
After solving the corners on two opposite faces using the
<a href=starter.html>Starter Sequences</a>,
instead of solving the corners on the remaining faces, solve the edges on the
two faces with the solved corners using the
<a href=edges.html>3-Color Edge Sequences</a> and some additional ones
<a href=starter_edge.html>here</a>.
Try solving random Starter Edge Cubes <a href=starter_edge_int.html>here</a>.
<br><br>
After solving all of the corners &amp; edges on two opposite faces (as 3-color),
solve the remaining corners using the instructions <a href=corners.html>here</a>.
The 6-color <a href=corners_6c.html>corners</a> can be solved before or after
the remaining 3-color edges are solved, however, there are some differences at
this stage with this method (see Solving Notes at bottom of page for more
details). Complete the solve using the instructions for 6-color
<a href=edges_6c.html>edges</a>.
<br><br>
An advantage of this method is that after solving the corners &amp;
edges on two opposite faces (as 3-color cube) the setups for the 3-color edge
sequences can always be matched exactly when solving the rest of the cube, no
need to make partial matches where only some of the misplaced facelets
get fixed. Another advantage is that the <a href=setups6.html>case</a> in which
no misplaced facelets can be fixed is avoided.
Disadvantages are that it requires more sequences and adds additional complexity
to the 6-color corner solving stage as described in the section below.
<br><br>
Solving Notes:<br>
If solving 6-color corners prior to 3-color edges and the 
<a href=parallel.html>parallel</a> sequence is needed then make
the setup such that the solved faces are on the left and right, otherwise two 
of the solved edges will get misplaced.
If the <a href=corners_6c.html#ww>waterwheel</a> sequence is needed and the
pair of faces where corners can be solved with half-twists (as 6-color) is
not the same pair with solved edges (example <a href=hta_odd.html>here</a>)
then one of the solved edges will get misplaced, fix it after applying the
sequence (with sequence 3C-E2).
If solving the 3-color edges first, then some edges will get misplaced with
either of the 6-color corner sequences but that is also true for the 3-color
solving method as described <a href=corners_6c_3.html>here</a> and
<a href=corners_6c_4.html>here</a>.</p>
