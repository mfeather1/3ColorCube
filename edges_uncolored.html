<p>To help illustrate how the process works the following shows other ways
of doing the same operation as 3C-E3.
All of these sequences work the same way by flipping one of the two 
<span translate=no> cubies </span> (via quarter-twist of center slice on
second move) then switching them (via half-twist on the fourth move), the
last three moves are the inverse of the first three.
<br><br>
The first cube below shows a minor variation of the original sequence, it
moves the two <span translate=no> cubies </span> to the top face (instead
of the bottom) to switch them.
The second cube shows another way to move the
<span translate=no> cubies </span> to the top face to switch them.
The third &amp; fourth cubes are variations of the second cube that 
switch the <span translate=no> cubies </span> on the front and bottom faces.

<p>The following shows other ways of doing the same operation as Sequence
3C-E4.
The first cube has a different starting position.
It shows a variation of the original sequence that moves the two
<span translate=no> cubies </span> to the top face (instead of the bottom)
to switch them.
The second cube has the original starting position and shows another way to
move the <span translate=no> cubies </span> to the top face to switch them.
The third cube is a minor variation of the second which moves the
<span translate=no> cubies </span> to the front face to switch them.
The last cube is a minor variation of the original sequence that moves the
two <span translate=no> cubies </span> to the front face to switch them.</p>
