<b>Cube Solver Help</b>
<br><br>
<p>To use the solver press the Random button and after a scrambled cube 
appears press Solve.
After a minute or so the solve will complete and a green bar appears under the
cube which is the media player control panel, press the Play button (right
arrow) to see the solution.
Subsequent solves will run faster, more about that in the "Search Time"
section below.</p>
<br><br>
<b> Entering Colors and Solving</b>
<br><br>
<p>To solve an actual scrambled cube press the Clear button and enter the
colors by first clicking on a color in the palette (six squares above
layout) then clicking on a square in the layout which changes it to the
selected color.
Press the Show button to update the cube on the right side of the screen 
to see that it matches.
<br><br>
Press the Solve button after you have colored the entire layout.
It will first verify that the cube is valid and if not it will give a message
indicating what the problem is.  
If you get an error, compare your cube to the one on the screen and find the
square(s) that do not match and fix them, then press Solve again.
Repeat until there are no more errors.
<br><br>
Once all the errors are fixed it will solve the cube and the green bar will
appear, press the second button from the right to show the solution one move at
a time.</p>
<br><br>
<b>Search Time</b>
<br><br>
<p>
If a solution is more than 20 moves then a shorter one can be found by 
increasing Search Time which is normally 5 seconds (by default).
Search Time is just one part of the total processing time.
Before the Solver can search it must first make several tables for moves &amp;
symmetry operations in addition to making the large search arrays (dist).
That takes a significant amount of time which can be seen in the log 
where it shows "Init + Dist Time" which can be seen by pressing the Solve Log
button after a solve completes.
The total amount of time to solve a random cube varies depending on the 
computing capability of the device you are running it on.
Only the first solve within a session incurs the Init &amp; Dist Time, 
subsequent solves take only the amount of time specified in the Search Time
box.
<br><br>
Search performance can be improved by generating the dist arrays to Depth 9 
which takes longer initially, anywhere from 17 seconds (on 3.7 Ghz processor)
to two minutes or more depending on device performance.
Generate time can be eliminated by using dist files as described in the next
section.
<br><br>
Note:<br>
In Firefox, if generating to depth 9 the browser will pop-up a message asking
whether to stop the script or let it continue, likewise if Search Time is set to
more than 10 seconds.
This message can be ignored (which allows the solver to run) or eliminated 
altogether by setting
<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Dom.max_script_run_time">dom.max_script_run_time</a>
in <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config">about:config</a>.</p>
<br><br>
<b>Using Dist Files</b>
<br><br>
<p>By saving the dist arrays to files they only have to be generated once,
then the files can be loaded into the Solver instead of generating.
The dist arrays can be saved to files <a href="../make_dist_files.html">here</a>
or they can be downloaded at these links: 
<a target=_blank href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LXrK-9F0kXLZu-3NZF8bsyIU45J0P-rz/view?usp=sharing">Dist1</a>
<a target=_blank href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i6dtWUcOtkDZzwtFOWuYRSqvAzrE3bWp/view?usp=sharing">Dist2</a>
<a target=_blank href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1osKQ_jSdjeGfpO4o4AuQOBXA5z-UyH_x/view?usp=sharing">DistP2</a>.
To use, click on the Dist Files button (on main page), then press the
Load Dist Files button and select the files (that you generated or
downloaded) then click Open.
After a few seconds a message will appear under the cube indicating that the
files have been loaded.
Prior to loading, the list of files needed by the solver can be seen by
pressing Solve.
<br><br>
Better performance can be achieved by using more memory.
Devices with 2 GB of RAM can add the very large search array Dist3 (418 MB)
which can be downloaded
<a target=_blank href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XWknRdQVV7H_sDHqDyzCGb4reYGRhKum/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
To use, click the Dist 3 button and load the files as described above.
</p>
<br><br>
<b>Searching For 20 Move Solutions</b>
<br><br>
<p>To stop the search based on solution length rather than search time 
use the "s" option (append to Search Time as in 5s).
With a sufficiently long search time the solver will stop at the first solution 
of 20 moves or less but if it is too short then the search will be stopped before
reaching the goal, in that case increase it.
The "s" option will remain in effect for subsequent solves, to switch
back to the normal search (stop based on time only) append "t" to Search
Time (as in 5t).
<br><br>
With the "s" option, there will be a large variance in the amount of time
it takes to find a solution (with 20 moves or less) so the wait may be long
in some cases.
After the solve completes the amount of search time used is shown below the
Solve Log button.</p>
