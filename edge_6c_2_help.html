<p>This demo shows how the last step of solving is done using the
<a href=edges_6c.html>6-Color Edge Sequences</a>.
If there are more than six misplaced facelets showing (on three faces) then 
the solver starts by half-twisting the three center slices 
to reduce the number as described <a href=edge_6c_hints1.html>here</a>.
The solver also uses the first two shortcuts 
<a href=edge_6c_hints3.html>here</a>
which are indicated in the solution table with SC1 or SC2 after the sequence
name.
In some cases it is only possible to match three of four misplaced facelets
in a setup which is indicated in the solution table with (3) after the 
sequence name.</p>
