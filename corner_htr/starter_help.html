<br><b>How To Enter Cube Colors and Solve</b>
<br><br>
<p>To solve a scrambled Starter Cube press the Clear button and enter
the colors by first clicking on a color in the palette (three squares above
layout) then clicking on a square in the layout which changes it to the
selected color.
Press the Show button to update the cube on the right side of the screen 
to see that it matches.
<br><br>
Press the Solve button after you have colored the entire layout.
It will first verify that the cube is valid and if not it will give a message
indicating what the problem is.  
If you get an error, compare your cube to the one on the screen and find the
square(s) that do not match and fix them, then press Solve again.
Repeat until there are no more errors.
<br><br>
Once all the errors are fixed it will solve the cube and a green bar appears
under the cube which is the media player control panel, press the Play button
(right arrow) to see the solution.
In some cases there will be more than one solution, press the Solve Log
button to see the additional solutions in the log.
<br><br>
The url parameter "facelets" can be used to enter a config which can be in
either 2x2 or 3x3 format (edges &amp; centers will be removed if in 3x3
format).
See Help on <a href=../text_input_cube.html>Text Input Cube</a> for 3x3
layout.</p>
