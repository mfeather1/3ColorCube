<br><b>Help - Corner HTR Solver</b>
<br><br>
<p>Press the Random button then press Solve and a solution will be shown.
Below the Solve Log button there will be two numbers shown in the form N + N.
The first N is the number of moves in the phase one solution which is a
half-turn reduction (HTR).
The second N is the number of moves in phase two which makes the final 
solution using half-twists.
<br><br>
In the log it can be seen that the search finds progressively shorter
solutions until it reaches Stop Len, in many cases it will be the first/only
solution found.
Stop Len can be reduced to search for a shorter solution but if it is set
below the optimal length for a given config then there are two possible
outcomes depending on if any HTR solutions are found, if so then the best
one is shown.
This means that if the solution is longer than Stop Len then none exist at
that length.
If no HTR solutions are found then a message appears indicating to increase
Stop Len. 
<br><br>
Stop Len can also be used to find optimal solutions by setting it to 0.
The log will show all solutions at each length until all minimum length
(optimal) solutions are found.
The number of solutions found varies widely, anywhere from one to dozens.
<br><br>
The url parameter "facelets" can be used to enter a config which can be in
either 2x2 or 3x3 format (edges &amp; centers will be removed if in 3x3
format).
See Help on <a href=../text_input_cube.html>Text Input Cube</a> for 3x3
layout.</p>
