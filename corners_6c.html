<br><br>
<p>Start by solving the corners using the instructions for the 3-color cube, 
to do that just think of the color on each pair of opposite faces as being 
the same (red-orange, yellow-white, blue-green), if that seems unintuitive
then look at <a href=6c_as_3c.html>this</a>.
The following examples show what a 3-color solution looks like on a 6-color
cube, corner facelets match either the center color or that of the opposite
face.</p>

<p>After solving the corners as a 3-color cube there are three possible states
that can be reached using half-twists only:
<br><br>
1) The corners can be solved on all sides 
<br><br>
2) The corners can be solved on one pair of opposite faces only
<br><br>
3) No faces can be solved 
<br><br>
The following table shows how to tell which opposite face pairs are solvable 
with half-twists, a more detailed description is 
<a href=corners_6c_cases.html>here</a>.</p>
<br>
<table class=tabdata style="border-collapse:collapse;border-color:white" border=1>

<p>If only one pair of opposite faces can be solved then place the cube so the 
solved faces are on the left &amp; right to make the setup for the Waterwheel
Sequence which is shown below.
For this setup it is only necessary that the left &amp; right faces are solved,
the other faces can be ignored (do not have to match cube below).
The sequence does not solve the corners, it makes them solvable with 
half-twists.
<br><br>
After applying the sequence (press Play) you can see in the above table (2-2
split, diagonal) that the corners can be solved using half-twists.
Go ahead and complete the solution using the mouse.
If it is not immediately obvious how to solve the corners with half-twists 
then look at <a href=corners_6c_solve.html>this</a>.

The first four moves of this sequence make the <a href=corners2.html>Waterwheel</a> 
configuration.
The fifth move is the one that "fixes" the 6-color configuration so it can be 
solved using half-twists.  The last four moves are the inverse of the 
the first four.
You can see how the sequence works on all possible configurations
<a href=corners_6c_5.html>here</a>.</p>

</div>
<br><br>
<p>If no faces can be solved then the above sequence will fix one pair of 
opposite faces so that the corners can be solved with half-twists, no
setup is needed.
To complete the solution, apply the sequence again as described above.
To avoid having to do the sequence twice use the 
<a href=parallel.html>Parallel Sequence</a> instead.

The 6-color corners can be solved before or after the 3-color edges
are solved. 
If the 6-color corners are solved first then solving the 3-color edges slightly
scrambles them but they remain solvable with half-twists.
It is not actually necessary to solve the corners prior to solving the edges,
just making them solvable with half-twists is sufficient.
If the 3-color edges are solved first then one minor additional step is needed
as shown <a href=corners_6c_3.html>here</a>.
<br><br>
For random corner cubes that are already solved as 3-color, the probability
for the number of face pairs that are solvable (as 6-color) with Half-Twists
Only (HTO) is shown in the following table along with the sequence used for
each.
<br><br>
<table style="border-collapse:collapse;border-color:white" border=1>
 <tr><td>HTO Face Pairs</td><td>Probability</td><td>Sequence</td></tr>
 <tr><td>1</td><td>50%</td><td>Waterwheel</td></tr>
 <tr><td>0</td><td>33%</td><td>Parallel</td></tr>
 <tr><td>3</td><td>17%</td><td>HTO</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You can try solving random corner cubes with half-twists 
<a href=cube_use.html>here</a> by selecting the option: "6-Color Corners:
Pre-Solved as 3-Color (HTO)".
There is also a similar option "ALL" for which the majority of configurations
will require use of one of the above sequences to make solvable with
half-twists.</p>
