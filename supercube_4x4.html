<font size="+2"> 4x4 Supercube Centers </font>
<br><br>
<p>To solve the centers on the 4x4 Supercube first twist pairs of centers
to get them all pointing in the same direction on each face using the
method shown below and then complete the solve by using the 
<a href=supercube.html>3x3 Supercube Sequences</a> to twist four
centers (as one) on pairs of faces.
<br><br> 
The following two sequences are used together to fix centers on the supercube. 
They are the same except that the sequence on the first cube twists both slices 
between the front and back layers whereas the sequence on the second cube only
twists one slice.</p>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <div style="width:160px; height:160px; display:inline-block"> 
    <script>AnimCube4("config=AnimCube.txt&colorscheme=ROYWGB&move=Rm Fw R' Fw' Rm' Fw R Fw'")</script>
   </div>
  </td>
  <td width=70>
  <td>

    <script>AnimCube4("config=AnimCube.txt&colorscheme=ROYWGB&move=Rm Fm R' Fm' Rm' Fm R Fm'")</script>
   </div>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
<br><br>
<p>The following shows how the above two sequences are combined to 
twist two centers (on front face) that are pointing in opposite directions
so they point in the same direction.
There is a half twist of the top face between the sequences and another at
the end.
This method also results in all four centers on the top face being twisted 
but that does not matter because at this point the goal is just to get all 
centers pointing in the same direction on each face.</p>
<br>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td>
   <div style="width:240px; height:240px; display:inline-block"> 
    <script>AnimCube4("config=AnimCube.txt&supercube=1&gabbacolors=1&initrevmove=#&colorscheme=ROYKGB&move=Rm Fw R' Fw' Rm' Fw R Fw' U2 Rm Fm R' Fm' Rm' Fm R Fm' U2")</script>
   </div>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
<br><br>
<p>To use the above sequence it is only necessary that there are two centers 
with arrows pointing in opposite directions in the locations shown on
the front face.
The direction of the arrows does not have to match the above cube nor do the
rest of the arrows on the face.
The result will be that the two arrows point in the same direction but not
necessarily in the same direction as the rest of the arrows on the face
(if the other two centers already point in the same direction then all four
centers will point in the same direction after doing the sequence but they
still may not match the rest of the face).
<br><br>
The following shows how the above sequence is used to get all centers pointing
in the same direction on each face.
In the table below the cube, "Make Setup" means to turn the cube so that there
are two centers with arrows pointing in opposite directions in the locations
shown on the above cube.</p>

<p>Complete the solve by using the 3x3 sequences.
Turn the cube so both the front and top faces have centers that need to be 
half-twisted and then apply the sequence to fix them as shown (moves 1-10).
Then turn the cube so the remaining unsolved centers are on the front &amp;
top faces, and apply the sequence to quarter-twist the front
counter-clockwise and the top clockwise (11-20) which will fix the front
but not the top.
The centers on the top face are now half-twisted so fix those with the
sequence that twists the top face only as shown (21-32).
The last move turns the cube to the home position (all arrows point up).</p>
