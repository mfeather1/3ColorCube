<p>This demo shows how to use the 
<a href=corners_6c.html>6-Color Corner Sequences</a>
to solve the corners of a 6-color cube that is already
solved as 3-color.
The Waterwheel Sequence is used when only one pair of opposite faces can be
solved with half-twists, the setup is having solved faces on the left &amp;
right as shown below, all other faces can be ignored.
The Parallel Sequence is used when no faces can be solved with half-twists,
the setup is parallel vertical pairs on the front face and parallel
horizontal pairs on the back face as shown (color of top row on back face
must match color of right column on front face), all other faces and centers
can be ignored.
The sequences do not solve the corners, they make them solvable with 
half-twists, for more information see above link.</p>

<p> For the last step of solving with half-twists an optimal solution is shown,
there is often more than one way to do it.
When solving manually you can do the last step any way you like, it is very
easy.</p>
