<p>The file with 10000 random cubes used in the suboptimal tests is available
<a target=_blank href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1INu5AOhSeLAJhXYFX3kbfEvEUqNsiZbP/view?usp=share_link">here</a>
(load with url parameter batch=1), the other files are built-in and selected
with the batch param as shown in the logs. 
<br><br>
A frequency distribution for the optimal 1000 test is 
<a href=fdist.html>here</a>.
<br><br>
For the 19 move optimal test the first 100 sequences with 19 moves were taken
from Herbert Kociemba's list of 100000 optimally solved cubes linked in
section "Optimal Cube Solver"
<a target=_blank href=http://kociemba.org/moves20.htm>here</a>.
<!-- <a href=http://kociemba.org/math/optman/100000optcubes.zip>here</a>) -->
The cube configs were made by applying the solution sequences to a solved
cube, so these are actually the inverse configs.
<br><br>
For the Quad-Core Solver test the presolved cubes were solved suboptimally,
for Solver 2 they were solved optimally.
<br><br>
The 77 cube presolved test is the set of configs that are 3-color solutions
and at the maximum distance from 6-color solution which is 16 moves, this set
is reduced by symmetry (see counts for
<a href=../dist_file_contents.html#distp2>DistP2</a>).
<br><br>
<p>With the computer used in these tests the solver defaults to eight
concurrent processes (one per thread).  In the optimal tests, param conc=9
was used which allows the 18 cube moves to be distributed evenly across
nine processes for better load balancing which yields a small performance
gain (~1 second for average solve).</p>
