<font size=+2> About Optimal Solutions </font>
<br><br>
<p>
While it is true that every configuration of a Rubik's cube can be solved
in 20 moves or less, relatively few of them actually require that many.
The number of configs that require 20 moves is as yet unknown, the estimate
is 490 million as can be seen in the third table shown
<a href=https://cube20.org>here</a>.
While that may seem like a lot, as a fraction of the 43 quintillion total
it is quite small: 
<pre>490,000,000 / 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 = 0.0000000001 
                                            (rounded)</pre>
<!-- 490000000 / 4325200327448985600 = 0.00000000011328955028 -->
<p>Hence the odds that any given random cube actually requires 20 moves
to solve are slim to none.
For a better idea of what to expect for an optimal solution see the bar
charts <a href=http://kociemba.org/moves20.htm>here</a> which show that a 17-18
move solution is the most likely.
<br><br>
While it is possible to get a solution in the optimal range with a two-phase
solver relatively quickly, proving that it is actually optimal can be much
more time consuming.
For example, consider an 18 move solution with search depths of 10+8 which
means that the solution was found at depth 10 in phase 1.
To prove that the solution is optimal requires completing the search through
depth 17 to show that no shorter solution exists.
Each higher depth takes 13.35 times longer to search than the previous so
the expected time to go from depth 10 to 17 is 13.35^7 = 75 million times
longer (note: the 13.35 growth rate can be seen
<a target=_blank href=https://sequencedb.net/s/A333298>here</a>).
What this means is that it generally takes significantly more computing
resources to prove that a solution is optimal than to just get one in the
optimal range that may or may not actually be optimal.</p>
