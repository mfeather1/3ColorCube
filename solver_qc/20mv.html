<font size=+2> About Optimal Solutions </font>
<br><br>
<p>
While it is true that every configuration of a Rubik's cube can be solved
in 20 moves or less, relatively few of them actually require that many.
The number of configs that require 20 moves is as yet unknown, the estimate
is 490 million as can be seen in the third table shown
<a href=https://cube20.org>here</a>.
While that may seem like a lot, as a fraction of the 43 quintillion total
it is quite small: 
<pre>490,000,000 / 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 = 0.0000000001 
                                            (rounded)</pre>
<!-- 490000000 / 4325200327448985600 = 0.00000000011328955028 -->
<p>Hence the odds that any given random cube actually requires 20 moves
to solve are slim to none.
For a better idea of what to expect for an optimal solution see the bar
charts <a href=http://kociemba.org/moves20.htm>here</a> which show that a 17-18
move solution is the most likely.</p>
