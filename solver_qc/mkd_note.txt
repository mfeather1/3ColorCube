  The file mkd.tar.gz contains C programs that can be used to generate dist
  files for the solver.  While it is mainly included so that Dist4 files
  larger than 1827 MB can be generated, any of the dist files used by the
  solver can be generated.  Dist4 can be increased to the size of the entire
  3-color cube by adding bits to the edge twist component of which each
  doubles the size.
