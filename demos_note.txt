File demos.tar.gz contains the original cgi demo programs that require
server-side processing which github pages does not support.
These programs have been reimplemented using javascript on the 3ColorCube
website with one difference which is that the solutions are hardcoded as
opposed to being generated on the fly which is what these cgi programs do.
These programs have been updated to use AnimCubeJS and can be run locally
on a linux web server that is configured to run cgi.
