The following shows how the permutation counts compare between the
Kloosterman & 3-Color methods.

For both methods:
Edge permutation has 5 components: 70,495,24,24,24
Corner permutation has 3 components: 70,24,24

3-Color Cube Method:

  Stage 1 (solve as 3-color):
    70 Corners
    495*70 Edges

  Stage 2 (solve as 6-color):
    Corners:
      24 Tetrad 1
      24 Tetrad 2
    Edges:
      24 M slice
      24 E slice
      24 S slice

Kloosterman Method:

  Stage 2 (see note 1 below)
    495 E slice as 3-Color

  Stage 3 (see note 2)
    70 Corners
    70 Edges 

  Stage 4 (solve as 6-color)
    Edges:
      24 Top layer
      24 Middle layer
      24 Bottom layer
    Corners:
      24 Top layer
      24 Bottom layer

  Notes:
  1. With edge & corner orientation solved, solving the E slice as 3-color
     also solves the top & bottom faces as 3-color (face solve only, not the
     whole layer).
 
  2. Unlike the 3-Color method where the two components of 70 are solving
     cubies as 3-color, in Kloosterman's method they are solving the top
     and bottom faces as 6-color.
