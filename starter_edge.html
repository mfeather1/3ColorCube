<br>
<p>To solve in a way that is more like HTA, add edges to the Starter Cube as shown below.
</p>
   <div style="width:130px; height:130px; display:inline-block">
    <script>AnimCube3("config=AnimCube.txt&buttonbar=2&facelets=rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll")</script>
   </div>
<br><br>
<p>
With the Starter Cube, in addition to half-twists for making setups,
quarter-twists of the top and bottom faces and the center slice (horizontal)
can also be used.
That makes it possible to solve new configurations such as the following 
examples.
The first cube below is solved with <a href="edges.html#cube2">Sequence 3C-E2</a>,
the setup is made with a quarter-twist on the first move. 
The second cube is solved with Sequence 3C-E1, the first three moves make the 
setup with a quarter-twist on the second move.

<p>The following configuration has a single misplaced facelet which can be
solved by using Sequence 3C-E2 twice with setup moves between (quarter and
half twists on moves 6 &amp; 7) as shown on the first cube or with fewer
moves using a new sequence as shown on the second cube.</p>
<table>

   <div style="width:140px; height:140px; display:inline-block">

<p>The following configuration has two misplaced facelets (second one on left
face), it can be solved by using Sequence 3C-E2 twice (with setup moves
between) as shown on the first cube below.
Another way to do it is with a slightly modified version of the sequence from
the above cube as shown on the second cube below (second move is in opposite
direction).
If the two misplaced facelets on the slice are facing the wrong way then 
half-twist the left face (or the whole cube) to make the setup.</p>

 <tr>
  <td>
   <div style="width:140px; height:140px; display:inline-block">
    <script>AnimCube3("config=AnimCube.txt&edit=1&move=R'Um'R2'UmRUm'R2R'Um'R2'UmR&facelets=rrrrrlrrrrrrrrrrlrlrlllllllllllllllllllllrllllllllllll")</script>

   </div> 
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
<br><br>
<p> Each of the following cubes have two misplaced facelets (second on left
face) which can be fixed as shown.
A single misplaced facelet in any location on the horizontal slice can always be 
twisted to match one of the two setups.</p>
<table> 
 <tr>
  <td>
   <div style="width:140px; height:140px; display:inline-block">
    <script>AnimCube3("config=AnimCube.txt&edit=1&move=R'Um'R&facelets=rrrrrlrrrrrrrrrrlrlllllllllllllllllllllrllllllllrlllll")</script>
   </div>
  </td>
  <td width=70>
  <td>
   <div style="width:140px; height:140px; display:inline-block">
    <script>AnimCube3("config=AnimCube.txt&edit=1&move=RUmR'&facelets=rrrrrlrrrrrrrrrrlrlllllllllllllllllllllllrllllllrlllll")</script>
   </div>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
<br><br>
<p> This maneuver fixes four facelets with three moves.</p>
<!--
If any three of the four facelets match the setup then two or three will be
fixed (depending on the adjacent facelet (on same cubie) to the one that does
not match the setup).
